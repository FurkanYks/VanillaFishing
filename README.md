# Fishing like vanilla. :)

![plugin icon](https://github.com/FurkanYks/VanillaFishing/blob/main/resources/fishing_icon.png)

this plugin adds fishing rod functions to fish when hook located at water. <br>
it works like vanilla fishing feature, when someone catches a fish u can see the animation of fish!

Also supports PocketMine API 5

It does not support FishingRod functions for pvp! only for fishing.
